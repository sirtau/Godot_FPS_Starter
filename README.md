## **Important Note - Please Read**

This tutorial was made for the Godot documentation way back in February, 2018, for Godot 3.0. Since then, Godot contributors and I have been maintaining it and fixing bugs, keeping it working with the latest versions of Godot.

However, **the FPS tutorial will/was be removed in Godot 4.0 as part of the documentation rewrite/audit**. I do not have the resources to continue to maintain and support the tutorial on my own, so because of this, Godot 3.2.3 is the last version of Godot that this tutorial officially supports. You can always find a copy of the FPS tutorial on my website, RandomMomentania: [RandomMomentania FPS Tutorial Part 1](https://randommomentania.com/2018/05/godot-single-player-fps-part-1/). My website also has working downloads for all 5 parts of the tutorial, the starter assets, and the finished result. The files there all support Godot 3.2.3.

**Huge thanks to everyone that has helped contribute to the tutorial over the years!** I really appreciate all the support, feedback, and encouragement!

The **old `README.md` text** is below:
